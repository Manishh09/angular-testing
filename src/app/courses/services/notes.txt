->  3 steps of a spec
    Setup,
    Operation,
    Assertion

->  It is always recommended to mock the dependencies of a service being tested
    Reason: 
    To make the Service isolate else it is not considered as a unit test

-> spies can be used for mocking the classes, services etc

-> tests are independent of each other

-> uses DI pattern

-> jasmine - test framework 

-> karma - test runner 

-> f - focus, x - exit 

-> fdescribe  - executes only this block
-> xdescribe - will not consider while executing 
-> fit - executes only spec
-> xit - will not consider this spec while executing
